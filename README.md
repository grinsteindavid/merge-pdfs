To make a JavaScript file executable as a global command in the Terminal on Linux/macOS, you can follow these steps:


1. Make the file executable:
   Open the Terminal and navigate to the directory where your JavaScript file is located. Use the `chmod` command to make the file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x index.js
   ```

2. Create a symlink to a directory in your PATH:
   To make your JavaScript file globally executable, you need to create a symbolic link (symlink) to it in a directory that is included in your system's PATH environment variable. Common locations for such global scripts include `/usr/local/bin` or `~/bin`.

   For example, to create a symlink in `/usr/local/bin`, you can use the `ln` command:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /path/to/your/index.js /usr/local/bin/myScript
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/index.js` with the actual path to your JavaScript file and `myScript` with the desired command name you want to use in the Terminal.

3. Verify that it works:
   Now, you should be able to run your JavaScript file as a global command from the Terminal:

   ```bash
   myScript
   ```

   The Terminal should execute your JavaScript file using Node.js, and you'll see the output.

Remember that you need appropriate permissions to create symlinks in system directories like `/usr/local/bin`, so you may need to use `sudo` to execute the `ln` command with superuser privileges. Use caution when modifying system directories.



An example of the directory structure before and after merging two PDF files:

**Before Merge (Directory Structure):**

Suppose you have two PDF files named `document1.pdf` and `document2.pdf` located in a directory:

```
my-pdfs/
│
├── document1.pdf
│
└── document2.pdf
```

In this example, you have two separate PDF files that you want to merge into a single PDF file.

**After Merge (Directory Structure):**

After merging the two PDF files, you will have a new PDF file that contains the merged content. The directory structure may look like this:

```
my-pdfs/
│
├── document1.pdf
│
├── document2.pdf
│
└── merged_document.pdf
```

In this structure, `merged_document.pdf` is the newly created PDF file that contains the combined content of `document1.pdf` and `document2.pdf`. You would typically use a PDF merging tool or library to create this merged PDF file.
